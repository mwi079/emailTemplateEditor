***How to run this POC***

- Open a new database connection to MongoDB Compass. The link referenced in the code is the default one, "mongodb://localhost:27017" 
- Open two terminal windows. In one navigate to the server folder (cd server) and in the other navigate to the client folder (cd client)
- Run "npm i" in each terminal window. 
- In the server window now run "npm run serve"
- In the client window now run "npm run start"
- The application should now be running. Saving a template will create a database in mongoDB called "templates" with a collection of the same name.
